# A basic quiz application
This is a simple quiz application that begins with a start page before launching a timed quiz. Correct answers earn 1 point, incorrect answers earn 0 and result in a 10 second demerit on remaining time. At the end of the quiz, the total score is a combination of points and seconds remaining. The user can then choose whether or not to add their initials and score to a highscores page that pulls from local storage.
